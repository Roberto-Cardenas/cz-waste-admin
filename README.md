The client is built utilizing ReactJS and is fully responsive. The website consumes and writes its data from and to a simple [API](https://github.com/Roberto-Cardenas/cz-waste-api) written in PHP.

The intention of this website is to allow the Waste Reduction Manager of the unit to provide an accesible and centralized way for members of the cooperative to find the relevant information when it comes to sorting waste properly in the 124 person unit. The WRM (Waste Reduction Manager) can easily update this information on the main site by using this tool. I wrote this project during my time in the WRM position in order to fulfill my duties of educating my fellow housemates on proper waste disposal and with the hope that it would be useful for the managers that would come after me.
